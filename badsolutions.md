# The Bad Solutions Hypothesis

` `  

> **For every problem, one can define a non-empty set of solutions that are simultaneously simple, easy, and completely wrong**.

This can be also named "The Deceptive Simplicity Principle" or "Twierdzenie Kuleszy o prostych rozwiązaniach". Developed over years of listening to various people trying to sell you stuff that for sure won't solve the problems you're having. Or think about politics and proposals to cut down spending on healthcare to improve it. The list of examples can go on and maybe someday I'll provide it.

Polish translation (as this was originally discussed in Polish): "Dla każdego problemu można wyznaczyć niepusty zbiór rozwiązań jednocześnie prostych, łatwych i kompletnie błędnych."
