# Jakkul's recommended reading

I've collected a recommended reading list over years of my IT experience. It's not long, just the stuff I recommend my friends and colleagues that I suspect will help them in their career development. Books, links, funny stuff.

Add a big lump of salt. Read first before recommending forward. Tell me if you like it or not. YMMV.

## Management (in IT mostly)

* **Corps Business: The 30 Management Principles of the U.S. Marines: Freedman, David H**

	[https://www.amazon.com/Corps-Business-Management-Principles-Marines/dp/0066619793]

	A great book about how much it matters to trust a team and how little various tooling means. 

* **Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage in Human Consciousness: Frederic Laloux, Ken Wilber**

	[https://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Organizations-Frederic-Laloux/dp/2960133501/]

	A great book on how to communicate in organization and how much trust matters. 

* **Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams by Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister**
	
	[https://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-3rd/dp/0321934113]
	
	An all time's classic
	
* **Parkinson's Law by C. Northcote Parkinson**

	(no link)
	
	A very old book on how basic systems theory applies to administration and corporate environments in a very very applicable and funny manner.

## IT systems development

* **Impact Mapping by Gojko Adzic**

	[https://www.amazon.com/Impact-Mapping-software-products-projects-ebook/dp/B009KWDKVA] [https://www.impactmapping.org/] [https://github.com/impactmapping/]
	
	Impact mapping or impact maps are a nice technique for understand what and why we _should_ do in an organization and what we _should not do_. In my opinion Mr Adzic proposes a very convincing and battle tested framework for applying this in real corporate life.
	
* **Software development unbreakable laws**

	One can find these scattered among different books, but these pages list and comment them perfectly
