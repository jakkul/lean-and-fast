# Feedback meetings

## The problem

Do you hate the evaluation processes imposed by your corporate HR onto your own Software Development Team? Do you think that what HR wants from you as a manager is useless, penalises good behavior and impedes personal growth? Or you're a new team leader and want to learn how to talk to people in your team?

Or you guys are running a startup and trying to choose a system to do performance reviews? (tldr: you need none)

I have a suggestion for you: _Feedback Meetings_

Especially today, in the post covid corporate world, proper communication between people working together is more important then ever. You are not able to guess body language remotely, one needs to establish relations in a different way.

Some companies already facilitate and encourage 1:1 meetings. These _Feedback Meetings_ help you by adding structure to these meetings, having you two discuss other things than just current stuff at work. It's about making sure that you touch on the right topics and address uncovered problems in the proper manner.

In organisations with high level of trust between people this process can COMPLETELY replace any other annual review process, provided that there is an open position grading policy with career paths documented and HR takes care of the salaries being just.

## Goal of the process

The goal of the process is to take care of your team members (or employees). Support them on every single level of the organisation. Help them to in the accomplish company/team goals and help to deal with discovered issues the most effective way.

The goal of the process is to establish a trust relationship between team leaders and team members. A trust is earned when someone delivers on their promises, so here we'll uncover problems that need action, commit to action, deliver and review.

The goal of the process is to make sure your people grows with the organization and the organization matures and adapts to the world around it by being influenced by it's people growing.


## Feedback Meeting scenario

**Rules to follow**

* The meeting happens between a team leader and a team member.
* Every person in the organization must have their feedback meeting at least once every quarter. Doing these meetings more frequently is recommended. Adjust to the pace of your team.
* Do not share all meeting notes beyond you and the person you were on the meeting with if not necessary.
* Share only relevant points from the meeting with relevant individuals or groups in the company. Special care needs to be put on discussing the right topics with the right people. Personal issues will require special care and confidentiality, while organisation problems require honesty and openness.
* Do not try to capture everything. Agree on 2-3 key points on both sides to act upon and deliver. You wonâ€™t get anything done if you plan too much.

## Talking points

The team leader needs discuss the following points with a team member:

* review progress on agreed actions from last feedback meeting,
* feedback by the manager on what the person did well in the last period,
* discussion on individual goals of the person being interviewed,
* discussion on company goals being cascaded down to teams and people,
* discussing how to help the person to perform on their full potential on:

  * individual level (i.e. what the person needs to improve individually),
  * team level (i.e. what problems are there in the team that need looking into),
  * organization level (i.e. what problems are there in the organization that need looking into),

* evaluation of the leader (i.e. what your manager should do differently, do less, do more),
* agreeing on actions after the meeting.

## After the meeting

* EXECUTE ON THE AGREED ACTIONS! Both the team leader and the team member.

## Taking notes and reporting

Both persons need to agree on actions to take after the meeting and take them down in writing. The most important part is having some track record of discussions between the two people: team leader and the team member. The rest is optional and relevant only if needed.
